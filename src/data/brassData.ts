  whyTrebleClef: `The ingenious tradition of the British Brass Band (developed in the 19th century in Northern England mining and textile communities) standardizes all valved brass into Treble Clef. 
Whether you play a tiny Soprano Cornet, Tenor Horn, Euphonium, or giant BBb Bass, written 'C' below the stave is ALWAYS open valves, 'D' is ALWAYS 1st + 3rd, and 'E' is ALWAYS 1st + 2nd! 
This means any band member can instantly pick up another instrument and know the fingerings without relearning clefs.`,
